Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The gpioInterupt project was to create a program on a TI board which took temperature from the temperature sensor on the board and outputs the information in Celsius. The second portion was to then have a set point number for temperature and set a onboard LED light ON and OFF depending on the real temperature vs the set point temperature. The board would turn the LED ON if the sensor temperature was lower than the set point temperature and was supposed to illustrate a heater element. Then when the light turned off the "heater" or LED when the temperature was over the set point number. The program was then instructed to output the information of current temperature: set temperature/LED ON/OFF (0/1):timer. 
The uartecho project was created to code that would read to the TI board. The input for this was the words "ON/on" and "OFF/off" this would then control a single LED on the board which would turn the light on and off and output the information to the user. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well in these programs was make the program work as instructed. Both programs took inputs and sent outputs exactly as they were instructed to do. Both projects were set up in an organized pattern as well which not only helped keep me efficient but also help other understand the work who may look over it.

Where could you improve?
A few areas I could improve is intext notes which I feel like I either give too much in depth information or not enough as Iâ€™m still learning how to give enough detail if someone else is trying to work with my product. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Some tools I took from these project sis how to work with TI boards, how to work with TI code compose studio. Using Texas Instruments website also gives me a lot of resources in how embedded systems work, and how to work with TI boards which in turn gives me a good understanding of how to work with multiple embedded systems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills I learned through is course and these project sis working with embedded systems and how they take in and read both software and inputs and outputs. This is information that can be transferred to other embedded projects and gives me an understanding of the importance of embedded systems and how we can take different boards and use them to accomplish tasks.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To keep this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable I added in line text to help guide others to the thought process. I also tried to keep the code as organized as possible and take as much unneeded information out, which reduces resource and time usage and well as making it easier to understand to the user.
